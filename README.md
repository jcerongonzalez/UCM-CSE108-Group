# UCM-CSE108-Group
Final Project for CSE108 - Built on Lab08. Complete revamp of the Courese Registration pages of UCM. 

3/20/25:
    @ 10:30 am, Jesus requested access to the University's course registration API, to hopefully make the project go a bit smoother.

    Ismiel and Jesus spoke briefly in the library about how the first page currently looks. 

    Ideas for initial page: 

    1. Our first idea was to only have the 2 'big' or 'main' options displayed on the first page.
    These being the; "Search for Class Schedule" & "Register for classes". All other options 
    can be accessed via a hyperlink underneath these 2 'main' options.

    2. Our second idea is to simply get rid of the "Prepare for Registration" page altogether and have a text box underneath the 2 'main' options and the hyperlink. This functionality will remove the need for students to visit a different page to see if they have a hold on their hold and their registration time and date is for next semester. We also had a thought about adding a drop down menu in the text box so students can view current and future semesters (maybe past, but we don't think it's needed).

    3. Our third idea is to either get rid or change the 2 buttons on the top left hand side of the course registration pages. Currently it's a path, that adds more buttons depending on what the student clicks on. The problem is that no matter which button the student clicks on it always takes them back to the initial page, this is useless. Maybe we get rid of it altogether OR we can change it to a drop down menu so a student can go from one page to another a lot faster. 
    4. The rest of the changes that we discusses are merely aesthetic changes.

    Ideas for the "Search for Class Schedule" page:

    1. This page is mostly fine. Unless anyone has any ideas for any major overhauls, we think we can keep this page mostly the same. Except for the aesthetics, we do want to change that.

    Ideas for the "Register for Classes" page:

    1. Our first thought is to have a pulsing UCM logo while it's loading, then we want to add more color to this page, maybe have a field of blue, with some yellow. We want to keep the drop down menu for the "Terms open for registration", but we wanna put it in the center (maybe keep this drop down menu at all times and move it to the a corner somewhere?).

    2. Now for the actual registration page. We were thinking about having a calendar take up the majority of the screen. Now, either if it's a new student's first time or if it's for registration for next semester we have a message over this calendar, something kinda funny/cringy, like "It's empty here... too emtpy..." or something and underneath this we have a "Search" button. My idea (Jesus) was to, when the "Search" button is clicked, a bar on the left hand side slides open which brings up the "Subject" box and underneath this box is an "Advanced" hyperlink that brings up all other optional criteria. This makes it look less cluttered. After a student searches a subject, it brings them to a menu of classes that are offered or will be offered, like how it currently looks, but make it a bit more aesthetic. 

    3. Our second thought was to add functionality so when a student has one class saved on their calendar, when they search for a different subject or for the same subject all classes that show up on the menu have an indicator stating whether or not it conflicts with the class currently saved. Our hope is this will drastically cut down on student time spent looking at the class times to see if which classes conflict. 

    4. Our third thought was to include an upward facing arrow button on the center bottom of the screen. When clicked, this will bring up their schedule in a non-calendar format, like how it currently looks on the bottom right corner.
